This system is a responsive web application built with Python and Streamlit. When a user selects one title through the interface, a tattoo design will be generated and displayed on the screen.

### <h3 align="left">Tools and Libraries used</h3>

* openai API

* streamlit


### <h3 align="left">Dataset</h3>

For this project I scrapped data from [BeerAdvocate](https://www.beeradvocate.com) which is then stored in beer_final1.csv. This CSV file 
contains:

* 8 columns (Beer_name, User, Rating, Comment, %, City, Country, Image)
* 450 unique beers
* 14688 rows
